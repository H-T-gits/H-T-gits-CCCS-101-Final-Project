# 💻 Justin Sorongon - Web Portfolio (CCCS 101 Final Project)

This repository contains the source code for a multi-page personal web portfolio built using **pure HTML and CSS**. It serves as the final project submission for the **CCCS 101** course.

## ✨ Features

  * **Multi-Page Structure:** Includes Home (`index.html`), Projects (`projects.html`), and Contact (`contact.html`) pages.
  * **Semantic HTML:** Utilizes modern, meaningful HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility.
  * **Responsive Design:** Features a mobile-friendly layout using CSS **Flexbox** and **Grid**, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.
  * **CSS Styling:** Uses an external stylesheet (`css/style.css`, not provided, but referenced) for clean separation of concerns.
  * **Simple JavaScript Navigation:** Includes a small JavaScript snippet to manage the mobile navigation toggle.
  * **Contact Form:** A styled, non-functional contact form layout (the submission part is style-only, as noted on the page).
